# Linear Algebra

Very simple implementation of some linear algebra algorithms. Each step is easy to understand, 
so it can be used for educational purposes.

## Eigen

QR algorithm to calculate eigenvalues, rank-one-decomposition to calculate eigenvectors.
Hessenberg transformation for eigenvalue and eigenvector calculation.
The rank-one-decomposition algorithm can be used to solve a system of linear equations.

Code for counting sign changes as per the Strum theorem. Recursive eigenvalue calculation
based on the Strum theorem over tridiagonal matrices as well as 
the Householder transformation for symmetrical matrices into tridiagonal form.

## Norm

Various vector and matrix norms. (1-norm, 2-norm, inf-norm, Frobenius-norm)
