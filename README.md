# Linear Algebra

Very simple implementation of some linear algebra algorithms. Each step is easy to understand, 
so it can be used for educational purposes.

## Eigen

QR algorithm to calculate eigenvalues, rank-one-decomposition to calculate eigenvectors.
The rank-one-decomposition algorithm can be used to solve a system of linear equations.

Code for counting sign changes as per the Strum theorem. Recursive eigenvalue calculation
based on the Strum theorem over tridiagonal matrices.

## Norm

Various vector and matrix norms. (1-norm, 2-norm, inf-norm, Frobenius-norm)
